<p><strong>Early stage</strong> â€“ when you start building the product.</p>
<p>I had a vision in my head of what I wanted my personal website to look like. I worked with various libraries building fancy and complex webpages. I realized the mistake I was making was that I was caught up on making my websites look cool but forgot about content. 
</p>

<p>So, for the time being, I've decided I'm going to focus on creating a simple website and work on creating not only good, but great content.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. Come back soon for something cool!</p>
