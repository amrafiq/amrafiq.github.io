<p><strong>Coding since I was 12-years-old</strong></p>

<p>Coding since I was 12-years-old on my parents Compaq and HP desktop computers, I've always had a vision in my head of what I wanted my personal website to look like. 

<p>After A/B testing through several website designs, I've zeroed in on a website design that aligns with my readers preference as well as my lifestyle, minimalism. It's just right.</p>


<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. Come back soon for something cool!</p>
