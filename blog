Ah! Us millenials. We're an interesting bunch. Not making enough money to pay rent is a common occurence amoung millenials.

I don't care how much money you make 

Ways to live below your means:
stop eating out:- let's admit it, if you're under 30-years-old, you have no reason to be taking your potenials dates out on lunch, dinner. The only exception is if you've already started your own business and are Mark Zuckerberg. You're not vulnerable enough to be even finding suitable mates. "I'm confused in my life, I don't know what I'm doing, but let's go out and eat to ignore real life and pretend everything is fine and make pictures for Instagram to get likes and feed our neediness so we feel people like us." Instead of eating out, learn to cook your own food. It's clean, you know the person that made your food didn't mess with it, and you don't have to throw your retirement savings away tipping a waiter who should have been fairly paid by the resturant manager in the first place.

stop keeping up with the khans:- stop fronting and trying to impress your peers buying or financing things you can't afford. No, don't finance that $60,000 car. Drive a car that makes up only 10-15% of your annual income. That means that if you're making $100,000 right out of college, congratulations, you can buy a used Audi/BMW/Mercedes or brand new Toyota Camry. You don't need that $400 bag to carry your money.

pay cash, don't use credit cards:- this one is hard to convince people to do. I know, I know. It's inconvenient to drive to the bank and withdraw cash all the time. But if must use credit cards, pay them off at the end of the month completely. No excuses. Can't pay off your credit card(s)? Stop buying things that you cannot afford.

cancel any memberships you don't use:- if you haven't worked out in months, cancel that gym membership.
