<p><strong>Owning an Agile Product</strong></p>
   
<p>Let’s start with some humor. <a href="https://youtu.be/BTTdHW8Z668">Here’s</a> Jerry Seinfeld  remodeling his kitchen, demonstrating to us how not to play the role of a Product Owner. Enjoy.</p>

<p>I'd like to acknowledge <a href="https://blog.crisp.se/2012/10/25/henrikkniberg/agile-product-ownership-in-a-nutshell">Crisp's Blog</a> as well as the book <a href="   https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half/dp/038534645X">'Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time' by Jeff Sutherland</a> for helping me grasp Product Ownership as well being the backbone of the development this post.
</p>
   
<p>No Product Owner can ever be successful without having a clear and concise product vision. A PO doesn't need to know every single detail but, they should know some things:</p>

<p>- Why are we building this product?</p>
<p>- What problems is this product going to solve?</p>
<p>- Who are we building this product for?</p>

<p>A PO can achieve this by working with their stakeholders to understand what makes them happy. Also known as "user stories"</p>

<p>Who is going to work on these user stories? An agile software development team completing 4-6 stories a week.</p>

<p>How is the development team going to achieve this when the stakeholders have LOTS of ideas and LOTS of wishes - especially since we're in an agile environment and those ideas and wishes change and multiply after each release without getting overloaded?</p>

<p>When a printer is printing slow, shoving more paper into the printer isn't going to make it print any faster, right? Same goes for our scenario. What do we do about this?</p>

<p>This is where yesterday's weather and the product owner comes in! If the development team has been completing 4-6 stories a week in the past, it is the Product Owner's job to find out what 4-6 stories the development team will work on the following week out of all the possible stories in the universe. </p>

<p>The Kanban way is to limit Work In Progress (WIP) - when the development team decides five is the optimal number of stories to work on without causing overload. When the team completes one story, they'll accept one new story.</p>

<p>Obviously, with WIP, there will be a queue forming - stakeholders having 10 new ideas every release whereas the development team is only releasing 4 - 6 stories every release results in a queue - this is also known as the product backlog. Delivering 4 - 6 stories creates a short feedback loop to the stakeholders.</p>

<p>The Product Owner maintains the product backlog in collaboration with the development team and stakeholders. The Product Owner seeks to understand each stories value (knowledge value + customer value) and (implementation) size. Some stories are more important while some are urgent. Also, important note. Value and size don't have any correlation! Bigger doesn't mean better! </p>

<p>Some stories might be equally valuable but one story might have a much smaller size so we'll build that one first.</p>

<p>The Product Owner continuously works with stakeholders to understand what stories they value. The Product Owner also continuously works with the development team to understand each story size in terms of implementation effort.</p>

<p>At first, our prioritizations and guesses on what to work on and what not to work on will suck. But that's okay because through time we'll get better. The value is in the conversations we're having along the way.</p>

<p>Back to the product backlog - the product owner needs to break stories down to bite size pieces. Small clear stories need to be at the front whereas bigger vague stories will be towards the back - creating a nice funnel shape. This is called backlog grooming.</p>

<p>You're probably realizing now that - to me, at least - Product Ownership is all about passion and communication thus ensuring the product vision is delivered. </p>

<p>Types of risks:</p>
<p>- Business: are we building the right thing. </p>
<p>- Social: can these people build it</p>
<p>- Tech: will it work on all the platforms we want</p>
<p>- Cost + Schedule: can we finish the product in a reasonable amount of time within a certain amount of money</p>

<p>Knowledge can be seen as the opposite of risk. So when uncertainty is high, we focus on knowledge acquisition. We focus on things like: user interface prototypes. Maybe not too exciting for the customer but still valuable because we are reducing risk.

<p>From a Customer value perspective: We know what we're going to build and how so let's do it. Build the most important things first and build the less valuable things.</p>

<p>Trade-offs:</p>
- Short term versus long term - should we focus on short term or long term thinking? Should we build that urgent bug fix or that difficult platform upgrade that'll enable faster development in the future. Working constantly on short term urgent fixes and not on long term platform upgrades is fire fighting versus fire prevention. Are we going to keep reacting to the fires around us or proactively work towards getting closer and closer to never having those fires in the first place? </p>

<p>- Build the right thing versus build the thing right versus build it fast - we don't want to rush too much into either. The Product Owner should focus on building the right thing. The development team should build the thing right. The agile coach should focus on building it fast.</p>

<p>- New product development versus old product improvement - a product is never finished. There is maintenance and improvement always to be done. Handing off products can be expensive and risky. So instead, we always maintain the product until its death. </p>

<p>Sometimes a stakeholder will ask when their stories will be done. The Product Owner's duty is to know the answer to this. Less is more here. We want to achieve the desired outcome. Our goal is not to achieve the maximum amount of output - our goal it to achieve the maximum amount of outcome. We should have an optimistic and pessimistic trend line to estimate when things will be done.</p>

<p>If a stakeholder asks, when will some stuff be done - this is a fixed scope variable time question. Sometimes stakeholders will ask what will be done by Christmas? That's a fixed time variable scope question. Finally, stakeholders may ask, can we get these features by Christmas? That's a fixed scope fixed time question. It's important to keep the product forecast updated in case stakeholders ask these questions.</p>

<p>It's generally better to reduce scope than to extend time. Because if we reduce scope first, we still have to option to extend the time later and the rest of the stories. Vice versa doesn't work because we can't turn the time backwards. </p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the product owner to be honest and truthful when responding to all questions. Otherwise, what's the point of all this?</p>

<p>Important Note: If the development team is continuously accumulating technical debt - they aren't writing test cases and improving the architecture - then they will get slower and slower over time and the story burnup curve will eventually flatten out. So the team is responsible for maintaining a sustainable pace and it is the responsibility of the Product Owner to not burn the team out.</p>

<p>Okay, that's it! Obviously, there’s  more to product ownership than this, so see this is a high level summary.</p>
