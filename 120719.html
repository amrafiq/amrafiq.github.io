<p><strong>My first month as a Product Manager</strong></p>
   
   
<p>It's official, I've been working as a product manager for 30 days, or one month.</p>

<p>One of the biggest goals I've had this first month was building and establishing relationships. 
  
<p>While you're busy running around removing roadblocks for engineers or absorbing information like a sponge from stakeholders, it's important to build relationships with them as well. Establishing relationships is quite essential if you want to be successful with all the stakeholders, product, and engineering folks you'll be working with.</p>

<p>Remember to have fun too.</p>
